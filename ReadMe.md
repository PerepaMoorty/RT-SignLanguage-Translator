## Introduction

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to interpret sign language gestures and translate them into text. The model processes real-time input from a camera and translates the detected signs into readable text on the screen. It aims to provide a seamless experience for users who need to communicate using sign language.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation**: Recognizes and translates sign language gestures instantly.
- **Customizable Model**: Built on a neural network model that can be re-trained on additional data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple GUI that allows easy interaction with the system.
- **Language Support**: Currently supports American Sign Language (ASL), with potential to expand.
